## Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 01: The Environment & Building Blocks

**Focus:** Python memory model, variable references, basic I/O, and type handling.

**Topics Covered:**

- Safe input pattern with error handling
- Variable swapping using tuple unpacking
- Type inspection and casting
- Float precision and formatting (IEEE 754)
- Integer division and modulo operations for time calculations

**Micro-Challenges:**

- **Identity Swap:** Swap two variables in one line without a temporary variable
- **Type Auditor:** Demonstrate that `input()` returns strings and explore type casting
- **Precision Banker:** Format float output to exact decimal places
- **Modulo Architect:** Convert seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds using `//` and `%`

**Files:** 5 Python scripts + comprehensive documentation

---

### Day 02: Logic, Control Flow & Truthiness

**Focus:** Conditional logic, boolean operations, and Python's truthiness concept.

**Topics Covered:**

- Floating-point arithmetic precision issues
